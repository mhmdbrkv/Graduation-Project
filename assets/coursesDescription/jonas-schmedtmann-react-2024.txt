In 2023, React is still the #1 skill to learn if you want to become a successful front-end developer!

But it can be hard. There are so many moving parts, so many different libraries, so many tutorials out there.

That's why you came here... And you came to the right place! This is THE ultimate React course for 2024 and beyond.

A practice-heavy approach to master React by building polished apps, backed up by diagrams, theory, and looks under the hood of React.

The all-in-one package that takes you from zero to truly understanding React and building modern, powerful, and professional web applications.

Real projects. Real explanations. Real React.



[01] Why is this the right React course for you?

This is the most in-depth React course on Udemy, and it's fundamentally different from all the other ones.

Here's why:

Contains the biggest and most professional project, where we implement many common app features (see promo video!)

Super detailed explanations of all important concepts with carefully crafted and animated diagrams

A huge focus on "how to think in React" and modern best practices

A long section that explores how React actually works behind the scenes will give you the confidence to use React effectively on your own

Advanced design patterns like compound components will make you think like a senior React engineer

And these are just the highlights! Check out the full list below (+ the promo video and curriculum).

Also, make no mistake: "React course" actually means "Front-end development with React and modern libraries course".

That's right, besides the React library itself, you will learn and master them all: React Router, Redux, Redux Toolkit, React Query, React Hook Form, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, and more.

This is how we plan, build, and deploy professional projects! We even use industry-standard tools such as Supabase (fully-fledged back-end), GitHub, Netlify, and Vercel.

As you expect, this course is 100% project-based. So throughout the course, you'll start building your portfolio of 8+ beautiful and high-quality React apps, where each one will showcase a few of the new skills you will be learning.

By the end of the course, you will have all the knowledge and confidence that you need to ace your job interviews and become the professional React developer that companies are looking for.

My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I've been teaching web development courses since 2015 to over 1,800,000 developers, so I know exactly how students learn and what is needed to master any subject.

With this in mind, I designed the ideal curriculum for this course: a unique blend of real-world projects, deep explanations, and theory lectures, to turn you into a confident React developer in just a couple of weeks.
